## How it works

Displays a bouncing IHP logo on the screen, with animated color gradient.

## How to test

Connect to a VGA monitor. Set the following inputs to configure the design:

- `tile` (ui_in[0]) to repeat the logo and tile it across the screen,
- `solid_color` (ui_in[1]) to use a solid color instead of an animated gradient.
- `white_background` (ui_in[2]) to use a white background instead of a black one.

If you have a Gamepad Pmod connected, you can also use the following controls:

- Start button: start/pause bouncing
- Left/right/up/down: change the bouncing direction (if bouncing) or move the logo around the screen (if paused)
